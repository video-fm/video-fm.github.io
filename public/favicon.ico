The file /laser-paper-website/laser-paper-website/public/favicon.ico should contain the favicon image data. Since I cannot generate binary image data directly, please ensure you have a favicon image file ready. You can create a favicon using an online generator or design one yourself.

For now, I will indicate that this file is intentionally left blank, as it should contain an image file.
